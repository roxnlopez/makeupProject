**TECHNOLOGIES USED** <br>	
I used Firebase as an API on this project, along with vanilla javascript. I also plan to pull in an external API.

-----------

Firebase Authentication is the goal today. I will also get my makeup API pulled in after.

-------------

Firebase Authentication is working!

-------------

I am deployed on Firebase and localhost:5000. I have a full stack app now.

-------------

Connecting my <a href="https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/">Makeup API</a> is a touch difficult. Like getting hit by a dumptruck, touch.

------------

Adding a child to firebase for my favorites heart link isn't working.
